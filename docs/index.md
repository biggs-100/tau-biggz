# Tau

Tau is a Python implementation of Pi's minimalist coding-agent harness architecture.

The project is intentionally built in small, documented phases. Each phase adds one layer to the system while keeping the core agent harness independent from the coding-agent app and from any terminal UI framework.

## Architecture at a glance

```text
tau_ai       provider/model streaming layer
tau_agent    portable agent harness, loop, tools, events, sessions
tau_coding   CLI app, resources, skills, extensions, commands, UI integration
```

The key design boundary is:

```text
AgentHarness = reusable brain
AgentSession = coding-agent environment
TUI = one possible frontend
```

## Current status

Tau currently has:

- project/package foundation
- development tooling
- a `tau` console command that opens the Textual TUI by default
- non-interactive print-mode prompts
- provider-neutral message, tool, result, and event models
- a provider-neutral model streaming interface
- deterministic fake model provider for tests
- OpenAI-compatible streaming provider
- a pure agent loop that streams events, executes tools, and grows the transcript
- a reusable `AgentHarness` that owns transcript state and streams events
- append-only home-directory sessions
- skills, prompt templates, and project instruction discovery
- slash commands with TUI autocomplete
- provider setup and switching
- beginner-friendly design documentation
